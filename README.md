# Sonar Signal Classification Project
 This is my first machine learning project, where we aim to predict whether a received SONAR signal originates from a rock or a mine. This classification is highly beneficial for battleships and submarines, as it aids in making informed decisions to avoid potential hazards.

 For this project, we used a Logistic Regression model, which is well-suited for binary classification problems. The process involved the following steps:

 Data Preprocessing: We initially preprocessed the dataset to ensure it was ready for model training.
 Data Splitting: The dataset was split into two parts: training data and test data. Typically, 80-90% of the data is used for training, with the remaining 10-20% reserved for testing.
 Model Training: The Logistic Regression model was trained using the training dataset.
 Model Evaluation: We evaluated the model's performance using accuracy metrics on both the training and test data. The accuracy scores were:
 Training data accuracy: 83.42%
 Test data accuracy: 76.19%
 With the test data accuracy above 75%, the model demonstrates good performance in predicting the source of the SONAR signals.

 Finally, we implemented a predictive system that can classify new signals as either from a rock or a mine.

You can explore the project and enjoy working with it!

# Thank you, and happy coding!
